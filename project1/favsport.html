        <h1>Favorite Sport</h1>
        <p> Growing up one thing that pretty much my entire family has in common was all of our love for sports, even if
            it was in a different way. My family consisted of athletes of many sports, but I gravitated towards
            basketball more than any other sport that was played around me. Being as though , all of my related peers,
            were older and good at the sport of basketball made me want to compete at that level and eventually one day
            be better than my family members at this sport. From that point on Iâ€™ve been playing basketball and taking
            it very serious, in which it has opened up many doors for me one of them has landed me here at IIT.</p>

        <h2> Favorite Basketball Team</h2>
        <p>Right now currently my favorite NBA team is the Phoenix Suns. I wish that my hometown team the Chicago Bulls
            were a dominant force as other teams but maybe they will be one day.</p>
