        <h2>Hobbies </h2>
        <p>My hobbies include listening to music, playing video games and playing basketball.</p>
            <p>I feel as if listening to music puts me in a different mind space as to where my creative juices start to flow and I think positive thoughts pretty much is the same for each hobby that I have. </p>
           <p> I also enjoy yoga and meditation from time to time.</p>
