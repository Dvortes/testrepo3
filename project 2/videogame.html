  <h1>Favorite Video Games </h1>
    <p> For some people video games may just be for fun or just something to do to pass up time. But for me video games
      are more than that to me. When I play video games they are often used as a coping mechanism which helps me clear
      my mind from the reality of the world around me. Video games give me peace and a free mind which pretty much makes
      me feel like a little care free kid again</p>

    <h3> Fortnite</h3>
    <p>Fortnite was released on July 21st, 2017. This is another game that I am very familiar with, and is also one of
      my favorites. Being as though this game has been around for some years, the updates are very consistent and new
      features are added all the time. Being as though this is a game where you do not have to pay for an online
      membership to play it is usually more fun and wide range in terms of who is actually playing the game. The
      Fortnite franchise has made over $26 billion making it one one of the worlds favorite video games. The game also
      includes playable characters from some of our favorite athletes actors and musicians also. </p>
